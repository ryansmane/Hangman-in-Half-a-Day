## Review
- I'm writing this in retrospect. This is bad. It works and it was probably one of the most technically intense projects of the class, but that does not make up for its shortcomings.
- Above all, it is unorganized - it is distressful. I tried annotating it and gave up after the third occurence of convoluted blocks of messy code. Width and heights and increments are hard-coded for the most part. Values such as 1684 and 1191 appear, or something close to that. It has flaws in its functionality that would be easily discovered if the user tried to find them. Nonetheless, I am proud of it. 

## Tech
- HTML/CSS/JS - Front-end only
- I did get to learn the p5JS library along with how to use Regular Expressions, which was very exciting for me as a beginner developer. They were things that offered a solution to complex problems through simple syntax and understanding.

## Process
- My original idea was too ambitious for its own good. To build an in-browser Risk (the board game) for two players with a week of dev time. Yikes. I got as far as six days into the project before I realized that randomly generating a block map and coloring it in based on arbitrary borders might actually be a fairly difficult technical problem (which I did get to work finally using a recursive method with *four* inner calls to itself, but it was too late and too impractical to work). 
- Time to complete: 12 hours - with some sleep lost.
